> ## AppUnite-2 // 07.2020
>> ### *This work the same like AppUnite-1*, but more modern and with new other technologies: 
- [x] Builded on one of my the best Webpack     
- [ ] (AppUnite-1) Redux & Redux-Thunk 
- [x] (AppUnite-2) Redux & Redux-Thunk & Redux-Saga 
- [x] All in the function components
- [x] React Hooks (e.g. useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo)
- [x] React-Redux Hooks (e.g. useDispatch, useSelector)
- [x] React.memo()
- [ ] (AppUnite-1) Works asynchronously with: asyncComponent()
- [x] (AppUnite-2) Works asynchronously with: React.Lazy()
- [x] Better syntax of code & fixed some bugs

### 1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
### 2) Run "npm start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy 
the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup 
(which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.
